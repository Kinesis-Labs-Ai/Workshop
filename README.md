This is a REPO with all the code, slideshows and any documentation that would be helpful for people attending our public workshops. 

You can look into the individual folders for more details. If you would like to propose a new workshop or run a workshop, please open an Issue. We love in-person hands-on workshops, meetups and discussion groups, and if you would like to run one, please create an issue for it.
